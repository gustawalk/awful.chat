// same anycast service as these and return the same reflexive candidate, while
// stun:openrelay.metered.ca and stun:stun.twilio.com have no DNS record at all
// (checked against 8.8.8.8) - every peer connection was waiting on two lookups
// that can only fail.

// No static TURN credentials ship in the bundle any more.

// They used to: username "awful", password "awful", readable by anyone who
// opened the JS, which made the server an open relay for the whole internet.
// The people that hurts first are the ones who NEED TURN - mobile and CGNAT
// users, who cannot connect directly - because the relay port range is finite
// and a stranger exhausting it does not slow those users down, it locks them
// out. coturn now runs with --use-auth-secret, so a permanent credential
// could not work even if one were shipped.
//
// TURN now comes only from /turn-credentials (see refreshTurnCredentials),
// which mints a short-lived HMAC per client. Until that answers, the list is
// STUN-only: peers that can connect directly still do, and relayed peers get
// TURN a moment later, on the first refresh.

// ponytail: openrelay.metered.ca was the "last resort" TURN and its domain no
// longer resolves, so all three entries were dead weight on every connection -
// a relay candidate that can never gather, three allocations that can only
// time out. Removed rather than replaced: awful.frav.in is the only TURN we
// control. If a real fallback is wanted, add one host that resolves.

 *

 * is a PWA - a tab can live for days - and this used to run once per
 * session with no timer at all: two hours after connect(), coturn started
 * rejecting every new allocation because the credential's embedded expiry
 * timestamp had passed, and every RTCPeerConnection created after that
 * point gathered zero relay candidates, silently (relay-audit.md
 * finding 3). Re-arming at half the ttl, not on failure, means a relayed
