/**
 * A share POST cannot be attributed to its sender from inside a service
 * worker. Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site are appended after the fetch event is
 * dispatched, so they are simply absent from request.headers here
 * (whatwg/fetch#1322 exists to fix exactly that), and the referrer is one
 * referrerpolicy="no-referrer" away from being empty - which is what a
 * hostile page sets and a genuine OS share may carry anyway. A referrer test
 * therefore rejects nobody who tries while risking every real share, so we
 * do not run one.
 *
 * What a page cannot fake is the shape of the navigation it caused. A share
 * is always a top-level navigation: the share sheet opens the app. A form
 * auto-submitted into a hidden iframe or an <object> is the only shape that
 * can plant payloads and hammer the storage quota in a loop without the user
 * ever seeing it, and that is what this rejects. A top-level POST from a
 * hostile page still reaches the handler - it also drags the user onto our
 * own origin in a visible tab, one payload per navigation, and the bounds in
 * storeSharedPayload are what keep that from costing anything.
 *
 * This is a deny list on purpose: an unfamiliar destination passes, because
 * silently dropping a real share is worse than storing a bounded record.
