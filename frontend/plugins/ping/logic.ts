 * congestion you are measuring, so you become part of the answer, and the
 * samples stop being independent - one queueing event smears across several
 * probes and a single bad moment reads as many.

 * retransmit, a buffer filling, a handover - these live on the scale of a
 * few hundred milliseconds. Sample much slower and you alias: unrelated
 * snapshots instead of a picture of one condition.
