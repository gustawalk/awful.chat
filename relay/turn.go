// defaultTurnURLs is what clients get when TURN_URLS is unset: this
// instance's own coturn, derived from DOMAIN.
//
// It used to be a hardcoded awful.frav.in, so every self-hosted instance
// silently handed its users somebody else's TURN server - and after a domain
// move, so did the original.
//
// IMPORTANT for anyone overriding it: the hostname must resolve straight to
// the machine running coturn. TURN is UDP (and raw TCP), which CDN proxies
// like Cloudflare do not forward, so a proxied hostname yields a TURN server
// that can never be reached.
//
// No 5349 entries. Nothing answers there without a certificate, and a dropped
// port is worse than a closed one: ICE waits out a full connect timeout per
// URL instead of failing fast. Add a turns: URL once coturn has a cert - TLS
// TURN is the only transport some mobile carriers allow.
