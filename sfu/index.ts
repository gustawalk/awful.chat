// Only rooms that actually hold media resources count toward MAX_ROOMS, and
// the resource counted is the router - see getOrCreateRouter below. A bare
// join allocates nothing but a Map entry, so counting bare joins turned an
// unauthenticated endpoint into a switch for denying every new call: one host
// holding a hundred idle sockets made every user who was first into their own
// room see "server full", indefinitely. rtpCapabilities are served from a
// template router created at boot, so asking for capabilities costs nothing.
// A router is the first thing a room really costs the worker and it outlives
// every transport in the room, so only counting rooms that build one is both
// honest about the load and impossible to walk past by asking for capabilities
// without ever building a transport.
// This counts ROOMS, and it is not the capacity ceiling - the port range is.
// mediasoup keeps SEPARATE udp and tcp port pools (the protocol is folded into
// its port-range key), so an N-port range allows N WebRtcTransports, and a
// participant in a call holds two of them (send and recv). The default
